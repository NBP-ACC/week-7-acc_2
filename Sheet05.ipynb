    "We want to know whether different scan behaviour is used when viewing images of different categories. Scanpath is a path followed by the eyes when viewing a stimulus. Scanpaths are useful for analyzing cognitive intent, interest, and salience. It has an advantage to a heatmap because the information about temporal structure of viewing behaviour can be plotted.\n",

    "- make sure that the order of fixation can be read out from the plot. E.g. earlier fixations could have a light color whereas later fixations could have dark colors.\n",
    "- also include information about the duration of each fixation. One way to do it is the use the size of the fixation marker.\n",
    "- plot the background image superimposed with the scanpath. "
